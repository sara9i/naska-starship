# naska-starship

This is an assignment project for Naska.ai.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository: 
`git clone https://github.com/sara9i/naska-starship.git`

For detailed Instructions on how to run the client(frontend) and server (backend) please refer to the readme files in respective dirrectories

## Project Structure

```bash
├── backend
├── frontend
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```
## Technologies

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#readme)



- `backend`: contains the server code implementation of the web application.
- `frontend`: contains the client code implementation of the web application.

## Approach to project

- Clean and simple code for frontend and backend.
- Use typescript for both frontend (react) and backend
- Focus on learning to use new modules such as three.js for frontend

## Future Enhancements

- Write Dockerfile for both frontend and backend and a docker-compose file at root of the project to get both server and client up and runing with a single  command and agnostic of operating system ~2-3 hours, more if we want to include networking and complete stack with db.
- Write more detailed and complete unit tests. ~1 hour
- Style frontend better and free of logical errors. ~3-4 hours (given I take backend as my stronger suit, frontend implementation would take me longer in comparrison)
- Optimize code structure as well as code for scalability on backend. (have seperate route files, move cors as middleware)
- Complete Swagger Doc for backend APIs
